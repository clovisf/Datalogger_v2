initial test:

nov/12/2014 1:00:00AM
- one measurement every 5 seconds
- no leds at all! 
- 400mAh battery
- temp/humidity DHT11
- temp LM35
- temp/pressure/altitude BMP085
- internal temp Atmel
- Battery voltage

temperature at 1:08:00 = 3C
humidity 1:08:00 = 38%
Pressure at 1:08:00 = 103kPA

______________________________________________

I have turned it off at 4:00:20AM, and the battery was still ok (around 3.55v) with measurements still being taken. Next time I will leave the circuit ON for longer
